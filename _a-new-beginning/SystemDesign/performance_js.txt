async and defer

✅ Use function declarations instead of function expressions for better performance.

✅ Keep object structures consistent to maintain V8 optimizations.

✅ Avoid type transitions (e.g., number → string) to prevent JIT deoptimization.

✅ Predefine object properties (null) if they may be assigned later.

✅ Avoid modifying prototypes dynamically, as it leads to megamorphic lookups.

✅ Pass global variables as function parameters in performance-critical code.
