MONITORING & LOGGING::
Monitoring, logging, and alerting are foundational to maintaining the stability and performance of a highly scalable React application. We use Sentry as the primary tool for a unified strategy covering both code errors and user-centric performance.

Here is a summary of the implementation strategy for our food delivery application:

Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting Summary
1. Monitoring: Data Collection Strategy (RUM)
The core of monitoring is implementing Real User Monitoring (RUM) to collect Field Data from actual user sessions.

Tool	            Sentry React SDK	Injects a small script to capture real-time user session data.
Error Monitoring	Automatic Tracking	Captures unhandled exceptions, promise rejections, and network failures with full stack traces.
Performance Monitoring	Core Web Vitals & Tracing	Automatically monitors LCP, INP, and CLS directly from the browser's APIs. Captures Transaction Traces (e.g., the time taken for the checkout route or the place_order API call).
Context	Breadcrumbs & Tags	Attaches user-specific context (user ID, browser, device, navigation history) to every event for easier debugging.

2. Logging: Error and Performance Visualization
Logging in this context refers to the persistent storage and organization of all captured data within the Sentry platform.

Log Type	Sentry Feature	Value in Debugging
Error Grouping	Issue Grouping	Sentry automatically groups similar stack traces into a single "Issue", preventing notification spam and focusing development efforts.
Transaction Logs	Performance Dashboard	Visualizes the distribution of key metrics (e.g., the 90th percentile LCP time) over time, allowing easy detection of regressions.
Session Replays	(Advanced RUM)	Allows developers to replay the user session leading up to an error or a slow transaction, providing exact steps to reproduce the issue.

3. Alerting: Proactive Incident Management
Alerting transforms raw log data into actionable signals, ensuring the right team is notified immediately when a threshold is crossed.

Alert Type	Sentry Alert Rule	Rationale for Use
High Priority Error	Issue Alert Rule: "Alert if an issue's rate exceeds 50 events in 5 minutes in production."	Catches sudden, high-impact bugs (e.g., payment API failure) that are affecting many users immediately.
Performance Regression	Metric Alert Rule: "Alert if the p95 LCP for the /home transaction is greater than 3.0 seconds over 30 minutes."	Catches performance degradation (slowdowns) caused by recent code changes, ensuring we meet our Core Web Vitals standard.
Security/Data Error	Issue Alert Rule with Tag: "Alert if tag area is 'auth' and tag status is '401' or '403'."	Proactively alerts security/backend teams to unusual authentication or authorization denial patterns.

By utilizing Sentry's full capabilities—from automatic SDK data collection to defining metric-based alerts—we ensure our React application maintains high standards for both stability and user experience, which is crucial for a competitive D2C platform.
