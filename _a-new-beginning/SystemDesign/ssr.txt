Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Process
The process you described accurately captures the core mechanism of SSR, which is designed to improve initial page load performance and SEO.

Server-Side Generation (Initial Render):

The server receives a request for a page.

It executes the React component logic, fetching the necessary data and rendering the components on the server.

Instead of rendering to a virtual DOM in a browser, React renders the components to a string of HTML. This HTML already includes the data fetched on the server.

The server sends this HTML string as the initial response to the browser.

Simultaneously, the server also prepares and sends the necessary JavaScript bundles (which include React, the component code, and the application logic).

Client-Side Download and Display (Browser):

The browser receives the HTML string and immediately starts parsing and displaying the page. The user sees the fully rendered content quickly because it's plain HTML, which is a major advantage for perceived performance.

The browser also starts downloading the JavaScript bundles sent by the server.

Hydration (Making it Interactive):

Once the JavaScript is downloaded and executed, React takes over on the client side.

Instead of rendering the entire application from scratch (which would overwrite the existing HTML), React performs hydration.

Hydration is the process where React traverses the existing HTML (the DOM generated on the server) and "attaches" its internal component tree structure, event handlers, and application state to it.

This is the step that makes the previously static HTML interactive and allows the application to respond to user input, completing the transformation into a fully-functional Single-Page Application (SPA).

Your phrase "superimpose the react component tree on the dom which was sent as html string and attaches events" is an excellent, concise way to describe the hydration phase.
