Image:
Responsive Image Sizing (Server/CDN):
Concept: Never serve an image larger than it will be displayed. The server or a specialized image CDN (like Cloudinary or Myntra's internal CDN) must dynamically generate the image at the exact required dimensions (e.g., 300×400 thumbnail for the list view, not the 2000×3000 high-res master file).
Benefit: Drastically reduces the file size in kilobytes.

Modern Image Formats (WebP/AVIF):
Concept: Serve images in modern formats like WebP (or AVIF) instead of JPEG or PNG.
Benefit: Provides 25–50% better compression than JPEG at the same perceived quality.

Lazy Loading (Intersection Observer):
Concept: The browser is instructed to defer loading the image entirely until the element comes into or nears the visible viewport.
Implementation: Use the native browser attribute loading="lazy" on the <img> tag, or use a custom implementation with the Intersection Observer API combined with virtualization.
Key Distinction: Virtualization manages the React components; Lazy Loading manages the image resource request. They work together: the virtualizer renders the component, and the lazy loader ensures the image URL isn't fetched until the component is almost visible.

Placeholder Technique (Skeleton/Blur-up):
Concept: Before the image loads, display a lightweight placeholder.
Techniques:
Skeleton Screens: A gray/shimmering block that reserves the image's space, preventing layout shift (CLS).
Low-Quality Image Placeholder (LQIP) / Blur-Up: Load an extremely tiny (e.g., 2KiB), blurry thumbnail immediately, and then swap it out for the full-resolution image once the main file is downloaded.


CSS::

Keep selectors short and simple. Avoid deeply nested selectors (e.g., body > div > #main > article > p). Never use the universal selector (*).	
Use properties like transform and opacity for animations instead of properties like top, left, width, or height
Minimize CSS Size	
Load only that css that helps with above the fold by extracting css using tools and inline them in <style> tags
rest load asynchronously
You use the rel="preload" attribute to load the file asynchronously, and then you apply the styles using onload.

HTML

<link 
  rel="preload" 
  href="/styles/non-critical.css" 
  as="style" 
  onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'"
/>
<noscript>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/non-critical.css" />
</noscript>
