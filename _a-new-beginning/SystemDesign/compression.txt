COMPRESSION::
Compression is essentially a process that transforms data (a file, a string of text, an image, etc.) into a different format that occupies less space, often by removing redundancy or sacrificing some level of detail.

The reverse process is called decompression.

2. Why it Works (Redundancy)
All compression algorithms work by exploiting redundancy in data.

Example (Text): In English text, the letter 'e' is highly redundant, and the sequence "th" occurs often. A compressor might create a short code for "th" instead of storing two full characters every time it appears.

Example (Image): In a photo of the sky, there might be 50,000 blue pixels in a row. Instead of storing the color value for each of those 50,000 pixels, the compressor simply stores: "(Blue, repeat 50,000 times)."

3. Types of Compression
There are two main categories of compression, differentiated by whether they sacrifice data quality:

A. Lossless Compression (Perfect Reconstruction)
Goal: To reduce file size without losing any information. The original data can be perfectly restored bit-for-bit upon decompression.

How it Works: Primarily by eliminating statistical redundancy (e.g., Run-Length Encoding, Huffman Coding, Lempel-Ziv algorithms).

Best Used For: Data where integrity is critical.

Examples: ZIP files, RAR archives, PNG images, GIF images, FLAC audio, and source code files.

B. Lossy Compression (Quality Sacrifice)
Goal: To achieve a much higher reduction in file size by permanently discarding information that is deemed non-essential or imperceptible to humans.

How it Works: Exploits human sensory limitations (e.g., the human eye is less sensitive to high-frequency color detail than brightness).

Best Used For: Media and streaming where file size is paramount and a small quality loss is acceptable.

Examples: JPEG images (removes color detail), MP3 audio (removes sounds outside the human hearing range), and MP4 video (removes redundant frames).

4. Compression in the Web (HTTP and Gzip)
Compression is a cornerstone of modern web performance:

Gzip/Brotli: When your browser requests a web page, the server often compresses the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files using Gzip (or the newer, more efficient Brotli algorithm).

Process (HTTP Negotiation):

The browser sends a request with the header: Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br (telling the server what it supports).

The server compresses the data (e.g., using Brotli) and sends the response with the header: Content-Encoding: br.

The browser receives the compressed file and decompresses it automatically before rendering.

This process can reduce the size of text-based resources by 50% to 80%, making pages load significantly faster.
