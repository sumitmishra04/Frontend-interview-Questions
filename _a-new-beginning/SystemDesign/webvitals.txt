WEB VITALS::
Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
What it is:
Measures loading performance.
Specifically, the time it takes for the largest visible element (image, video, text block) to render on the screen.
Good Threshold:
≤ 2.5 seconds → good
2.5–4.0 → needs improvement
4.0 → poor
Why it matters:
Users perceive the page is ready once the main content loads.
Slow LCP → users bounce.
Use case:
Homepage hero image, main article text, product images on e-commerce.
Optimize by lazy-loading non-critical assets, compressing images, and using fast server responses.


First Input Delay (FID)
What it is:
Measures interactivity.
Time from user’s first interaction (click, tap, keypress) → browser is able to respond.
Good Threshold:
≤ 100ms → good
100–300ms → needs improvement
300ms → poor
Why it matters:
Users feel frustrated if the page looks interactive but doesn’t respond.
Use case:
Buttons, links, forms, search boxes.
Optimize by splitting heavy JS, using web workers, and minimizing main-thread blocking.

Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
What it is:
Measures visual stability.
Sum of all unexpected layout shifts during the page lifecycle.
Good Threshold:
≤ 0.1 → good
0.1–0.25 → needs improvement
0.25 → poor
Why it matters:
Sudden shifts frustrate users (like a button moving before click).
Impacts perceived quality and trust.
Use case:
Ads, images without width/height, dynamic content.
Optimize by reserving space for images, ads, and fonts.

4️⃣ First Contentful Paint (FCP)
What it is:
Time until first visible content appears on the screen (text, image, canvas).
Good Threshold:
≤ 1.8s → good
1.8–3s → needs improvement
3s → poor
Why it matters:
Gives first feedback to the user that something is happening.
Helps reduce bounce rate.
Use case:
Critical above-the-fold content.
Optimize by minimizing render-blocking CSS/JS, inlining critical CSS.

5️⃣ Time to Interactive (TTI)
What it is:
Time until page is fully interactive (ready for input without lag).
Good Threshold:
≤ 3.8s → good
Why it matters:
Page may look loaded (FCP/LCP), but user cannot interact yet → frustration.
Use case:
React-heavy apps, SPAs, e-commerce checkout pages.
Optimize by code-splitting, lazy-loading non-critical JS, reducing main-thread work.

6 Interaction to Next Paint (INP)
What it is:
Measures responsiveness for every interaction, newer alternative to FID.
Why it matters:
FID only measures first input; INP gives full picture of UX interactivity.


✅ TL;DR Chronological Sequence (Load → Ready → Interactivity → Stability)
Metric	Stage	What it Measures
FCP	Early load	First content appears
LCP	Load	Largest content rendered
CLS	Load & interactions	Visual stability / layout shifts
TBT(Total Blocking Time)	Load → interactivity	JS blocking main thread
FID	First input	First interaction delay
TTI	Interactivity	Page fully interactive
INP	Continuous	Responsiveness to all interactions

Key Takeaways for Frontend Devs:
FCP + LCP → perceived loading speed
FID / TBT / TTI / INP → interactivity/responsiveness
CLS → visual stability
Optimizing Web Vitals → faster, smoother, less frustrating UX → better SEO & conversions.
