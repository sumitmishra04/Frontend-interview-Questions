step 1 [Requirement gathering]: 
What are the main use cases we should be focusing on?

Step 2 [Jira Epics]:
Functional Requirements: Feature around the decided scope
Non Functional Requirements: Performance, scalability, good UX

NFR: Device support, offline capabilities, users of the product, i18n, accessibility, security,
performance aspects

Step 3 [Draw]: 
- identifying the key components of the product, 
- how the components interact with each other,
- how they are related
UI components with index.js
index.js => useHooks => api layer  => backend
response => store data in the useReducer with context

Step 4 [component props]:
- for each component discuss what kind of data it will require to render mainly props it needs. 

Step 5 [protocols, payload and responses]: 
- design api interface for each of them. also discuss the protocol like web socket, polling or simple rest call
- the payload and response structure


Step 6 [performance, optimisation and supports and analytics]:
- network optimisation: like smaller chunks, fewer api calls, lazy loading module and data, throttling, debounce,
- scroll optimisation: infinite scrolling, cursor vs offset based pagination, 
- image optimisation: image format, device specific image size, lazy loading images
- accessibility: key things to make accessible
- service worker for offline capabilities and caching static resources
- react query to cache api responses or web worker to handle heavy computation 
- i18n and l10n
- security like xss, csp, csrf, sandboxing, https
- multi-device Support
- monitoring and logging
