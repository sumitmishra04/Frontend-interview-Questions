🧩 The Context

Hotel booking systems (like Booking.com, Agoda, Expedia) are a mix of:

Highly dynamic data (prices, availability)

Search-heavy UIs

SEO-sensitive landing pages (city, destination pages)

Personalized content after login

That means: one size doesn’t fit all pages.

So you’ll typically combine CSR + SSR + selective hydration (or streaming) depending on the page’s purpose.



⚙️ Let’s break down each option
1️⃣ CSR (Client-Side Rendering)

Browser downloads HTML shell + JS bundle → React bootstraps → fetches data → renders everything.

✅ Pros

Simpler architecture (no server-side React runtime)

Easy CDN caching of static shell

Full control via React Query caching layer

Fast after first load (SPA experience)

Works great for authenticated users (no SEO concern)

❌ Cons

Blank screen on first load (poor FCP/LCP)

Weak SEO (search crawlers get empty HTML)

Slow initial page (especially on slow networks)

Duplication of API calls if not cached at CDN/SW


🏁 When to use

Authenticated or internal pages (e.g., booking flow after login)

Dashboard-like sections (manage bookings)

Low SEO requirement pages

✅ Verdict for hotel booking:
Use CSR for the search results, booking steps, payment flow, etc.
These are user-specific and data changes rapidly (SSR caching won’t help).



2️⃣ SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

React renders the full HTML on the server → sends it → browser hydrates it.

✅ Pros

Instant first paint (good for FCP/LCP)

SEO-friendly (full HTML served to crawlers)

Can prefetch dynamic data server-side

Better perceived performance for first interaction

❌ Cons

More infra complexity (React server runtime)

Harder caching (since output depends on search params, filters)

Need streaming SSR or partial hydration to avoid blocking TTFB

Server cost goes up if each request renders fresh React tree

🏁 When to use

SEO-critical pages: “Hotels in Goa”, “Top Resorts in Bali”, etc.

Landing pages with high organic traffic

Marketing or static data (can revalidate every few minutes)

✅ Verdict for hotel booking:
Use SSR for landing pages and destination listings (first page of results).
You can cache those for a short TTL (30–60s) at the CDN.


3️⃣ Hydration (React Hydration / Partial Hydration / Streaming)

Hydration is the process of taking SSR-rendered HTML and attaching client-side JS event handlers after load.

Hydration itself isn’t a separate approach, but a necessary bridge between SSR → CSR.
However, frameworks (Next.js, Remix, Astro, Qwik) let you control hydration granularity.

✅ Pros

Combine SSR’s instant HTML with CSR’s interactivity

Can stream content chunks (React 18 SSR streaming)

Possible to defer hydration of heavy components (filters, maps, etc.)

❌ Cons

Still needs JS bundle (you can’t skip hydration for interactive parts)

Complex debugging for hydration mismatch

Partial hydration (Astro/Qwik) adds build complexity

🏁 When to use

For mixed pages like hotel detail (has static info + dynamic pricing)

When you need SEO and fast interactivity

To gradually hydrate interactive widgets

✅ Verdict for hotel booking:
Use SSR + selective hydration for hotel detail pages.
Render hero section (hotel name, images, rating) on server, hydrate reviews, pricing, map asynchronously.

| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Homepage**                               | **Static (SSG + CDN)**        | Fast, cacheable, SEO          |
| **Destination Listing** (`/hotels-in-goa`) | **SSR (Edge Cached)**         | SEO, fast initial load        |
| **Search Results** (with filters, dates)   | **CSR (React Query)**         | Highly dynamic, user-specific |
| **Hotel Details** (`/hotel/123`)           | **SSR + selective hydration** | SEO + dynamic pricing refresh |
| **Booking / Checkout**                     | **CSR (protected route)**     | Authenticated, sensitive data |
| **Confirmation / Dashboard**               | **CSR**                       | Personalized, no SEO          |


| Type                        | Use it for                                                  | Verdict |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **CSR only**                | Logged-in, dynamic, transactional flows (booking, payments) | ✅ Yes   |
| **SSR + hydration**         | SEO-critical or semi-static pages (listing, details)        | ✅ Yes   |
| **Pure SSR (no hydration)** | Static marketing pages                                      | ✅ Yes   |
| **SSG (static generation)** | Homepage, top destinations                                  | ✅ Yes   |
| **Full SSR everywhere**     | No — overkill, expensive                                    | ❌ No    |
| **CSR only everywhere**     | No — SEO disaster for hotel search                          | ❌ No    |
