Metric/logging 

FR: the functionalities user interacts with actively or passively
NFR: that helps system perform well, speed, availability, optimise performance 

FR:
- platform agnostic
- data be configurable. eg onboarding process: track start to end of onboarding funnel to see where user drop off.
  dashboard: where u wanna see which elements is interacting with.
  login form: is the form too big and user is dropping off.
  base on use case the nature of data that can be collected varies.
- visualization of data


NFR:
- highly available
- low latency (need real time info like live matches or money related to make quick decisions.)
- validation of data 


Data collection:
post api 
{
    page: 
    timestamp:
    event: click | pageview | scroll | cancel | submit | appCrash {stack trace}
    auxiliary data
    user:
    location:
    session
}

System Architecture
user =>[api request]=> Load balancer => queue => validation service => [data enrichment + [DB]] => NoSql dB
visualition tool => NoSql DB
serving cached results like daily active users.

for billion of user collect a sample smaller Amount
data retention policy of 90 days
for data longer than 90 days we can use a long db that will be slower but will provide the historical data
feed the data to amplitude for visualisation

we could make the system self-serve to make sure all users can use it
sharding by product categories or days to improve latency
