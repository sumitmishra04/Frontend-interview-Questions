Unit Testing (Focus: Functions & Small Components)

Component Isolation	Verify a small, stateless component renders correctly given specific props.	Jest, React Testing Library (RTL)	Test the <ProductCardTitle> component to ensure it correctly displays the productName prop and truncates it if it exceeds 50 characters.
Hook Logic	Test the logic within custom hooks (e.g., state initialization, derived state, side effects).	Jest, RTL's renderHook utility	Test a custom hook useCartState to ensure calling addItem(item) correctly increments the item count and updates the total price state.
Pure Functionality	Test helper functions that have no side effects (e.g., formatting data).	Jest	Test a utility function formatPrice(price) to ensure the number 1234.56 correctly returns the localized string "₹1,234".


Component/Integration Testing (Focus: Feature Logic & API Mocks)
This layer focuses on how components work together, simulating browser events and API responses.

API Mocking	Test a component that fetches data without making a real network call.	Mock Service Worker (MSW), Jest	Test the <ProductFilters> component: Mock the API call that fetches available colors. Assert that once the mocked data returns, the correct number of color checkboxes appears on the screen.
User Interaction	Test a complex interaction flow within a contained feature (simulating clicks, typing).	RTL (fireEvent, userEvent)	Test the <SearchBox> component: Type "t-shirt" into the input, and assert that the component immediately displays a loading spinner and then renders the search results list.
Context/Redux Connection	Test if a component correctly reads from and dispatches actions to a global state store.	Jest, Redux Mock Store	Test the <AddToCartButton> component to ensure that clicking it dispatches the cart/itemAdded action with the correct product ID and quantity payload.


End-to-End (E2E) Testing (Focus: Full User Flow)
This tests the application running in a real browser against a deployed environment (Staging or QA).

Critical Path Validation	Ensure the most valuable user journeys are functional from start to finish.	Cypress, Playwright	Checkout Flow: Navigate to the homepage → Search for "dress" → Click the first product → Select size → Click 'Add to Bag' → Go to Cart → Click 'Checkout' → Verify the Shipping Address step loads correctly.
Cross-Browser/Device	Verify layout and functionality on different browsers and mobile viewports.	Cypress, BrowserStack/Sauce Labs	Test the image carousel on the product details page to ensure swipe gestures work on a simulated mobile viewport in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
