When you type https://www.example.com in your browser and press Enter:

The browser extracts the domain name (www.example.com).
It checks if the domain is cached (locally like in browser, os or router cache or in DNS cache).
If not cached, it sends a DNS request to get the IP address of www.example.com.


DNS (Domain Name System) acts like the phonebook of the internet and translates the domain into an IP address (e.g., 203.0.113.10).

The browser gets the server’s IP address and now knows where to connect.


Now that the browser has the IP, it needs to establish a secure connection.

Since HTTPS runs over TCP, the browser first establishes a TCP connection with the server:

Client (Browser) → SYN → Server (Requests to open a connection).
Server → SYN-ACK → Client (Acknowledges and agrees).
Client → ACK → Server (Confirms, connection established).
🔹 At this stage, the client and server can communicate, but it’s still unencrypted.

Since the website uses HTTPS, SSL/TLS encryption is established on top of TCP.

Step 2: SSL/TLS Handshake (Secure Key Exchange)
Client Hello:

The browser sends a message listing supported encryption algorithms (ciphers).
It also sends a random number to help generate encryption keys.
Server Hello:

The server selects a cipher from the client’s list.
It also sends its SSL certificate (issued by a trusted Certificate Authority, CA).
Another random number is sent for key generation.
Certificate Verification:

The browser validates the SSL certificate:
Is it signed by a trusted CA?
Is it expired or revoked?
Does the domain match the certificate?
Key Exchange:

The client and server generate a shared encryption key using either:
RSA (older method): The client encrypts a secret key with the server’s public key.
Diffie-Hellman (modern method): Both client and server contribute to a key.
Session Key Established:

Both sides now have a shared session key for symmetric encryption (faster than public-key encryption).
Finished Messages:

Both parties confirm that encryption is set up, and secure communication begins.
🔹 Now, all data exchanged between the client and server is encrypted and secure.
