    "In this question, you need to implement a custom `mapLimit` function that takes 4 arguments.\r\n\r\n## Arguments\r\n\r\n1. `inputs`: An array of inputs\r\n2. `limit`: The maximum number of operations at any given time.\r\n3. `iterateeFn`: The async function that should be called with each input to generate the corresponding output. It will have two arguments:\r\n    - `input`: The input being processed\r\n    - `callback`: A function that will be called when the input is finished processing. It will be provided with one argument, the processed `output`.\r\n4. `callback`: A function that should be called with the array of outputs once all inputs have been processed.\r\n\r\nAt any given point, your program can make max 2 calls i.e. at any given point your program can process `1, 2` or `2, 3` or so on user ids.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmapLimit([1,2,3,4,5], 2, getUserById, (allResults) => {\r\n  console.log('output:', allResults) // [\"User1\", \"User2\", \"User3\", \"User4\", \"User5\"]\r\n})\r\n```",

    "In this coding challenge, we need to build an interactive feature where circles are drawn on the screen in response to user clicks. The circles will have specific behaviors based on user actions such as dragging, clicking, and overlapping. The application should dynamically update the circle's size during a drag operation and detect when two circles overlap, changing the color of the second circle in such cases.\r\n\r\n## Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n1. **Left Mouse Button (Primary Circle)**:\r\n   - When the user clicks and drags with the left mouse button, a circle should be drawn at the initial click position. The radius of the circle should adjust in real time as the user drags the mouse.\r\n   - Once the user releases the left mouse button, the circle should be finalized.\r\n   - If the user left clicks without dragging, left circle should be cleared from the screen.\r\n\r\n2. **Right Mouse Button (Secondary Circle)**:\r\n   - The same functionality should apply to the right mouse button, allowing the user to place a second circle by clicking and dragging. \r\n   - The circle should adjust in real time as the user drags the mouse and be finalized upon releasing the right mouse button.\r\n   - If the user right clicks without dragging, right circle should be cleared from the screen.\r\n\r\n3. **Circle Overlap Detection**:\r\n   - If circles overlap, the later circle in the sequence (the one that was created second) should change its color.\r\n   - The overlap should be recalculated every time a circle is created or updated.\r\n\r\n4. **Replacing Circles**:\r\n   - Each time the user draws a circle with the left or right mouse button, the existing circle for that button should be replaced with the new one.\r\n\r\n## Mockups\r\n\r\n- Non-overlapping circles\r\n\r\n![non-overlapping circles](https://ik.imagekit.io/devtoolstech/question-images/overlapping-circles/Screenshot%202024-12-14%20at%201.45.03%E2%80%AFPM_apu7KkXkwV.png?updatedAt=1734164213166)\r\n\r\n- Overlapping circles\r\n\r\n![overlapping circles](https://ik.imagekit.io/devtoolstech/question-images/overlapping-circles/Screenshot%202024-12-14%20at%201.45.18%E2%80%AFPM_b7Jo45-8U9.png?updatedAt=1734164213210)\r\n\r\n## Demo and Solution\r\n\r\n<div style=\"position:relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\r\n<iframe\r\nstyle=\"position:absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width:100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bgKMaqk2WKw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## Submission\r\n\r\nStart the timer, complete your solution, test your solution against the test cases provided by the platform, and submit it.

    "## Problem Statement\r\n\r\nIn this question, the candidate needs to build an interactive word search game application (Boggle Dictionary). You would be provided with a list of pre-defined words. Each character of the word needs to randomly place in a grid. The user of the game should be able to select characters in a sequence (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

    "## Problem Statement\r\n\r\nYou are tasked with building a function to validate organizational hierarchy data. Given a dataset of direct reporting relationships between individuals, you need to determine whether these relationships represent a valid organizational structure.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nYour solution must verify that the reporting relationships satisfy all of the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1. **Single Ultimate Leader**: There should be exactly one person who doesn't report to anyone.\r\n2. **No Circular Reporting**: No individual can directly or indirectly report to themselves (no cycles in the hierarchy)\r\n3. **Connected Organization**: Every individual must be part of the same organizational structure (all nodes should be reachable from the root)\r\n\r\n## Function Signature\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction isValidOrganization(relationships) {\r\n    // Your implementation here\r\n    // Return true if valid, false otherwise\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Input Format\r\n\r\n- `relationships`: An array of pairs `[manager, subordinate]`\r\n- Each pair indicates that `manager` directly manages `subordinate`\r\n- Names are represented as strings\r\n\r\n## Output\r\n\r\n- Return `true` if the relationships form a valid organizational hierarchy\r\n- Return `false` otherwise\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### Example 1: Valid Organization\r\n```javascript\r\nconst relationships1 = [\r\n    [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"],\r\n    [\"Alice\", \"Charlie\"],\r\n    [\"Bob\", \"David\"],\r\n    [\"Bob\", \"Eve\"]\r\n];\r\n\r\nconsole.log(isValidOrganization(relationships1)); // true\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Explanation**: Alice is the ultimate leader, no cycles exist, and all individuals are connected in a tree structure.\r\n\r\n### Example 2: Invalid Organization (Circular Reporting)\r\n```javascript\r\nconst relationships2 = [\r\n    [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"],\r\n    [\"Bob\", \"Charlie\"],\r\n    [\"Charlie\", \"Alice\"]\r\n];\r\n\r\n// false\r\nconsole.log(isValidOrganization(relationships2));\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Explanation**: There's a cycle where Alice → Bob → Charlie → Alice, violating the \"no circular reporting\" rule.\r\n\r\n### Example 3: Invalid Organization (Multiple Leaders)\r\n```javascript\r\nconst relationships3 = [\r\n    [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"],\r\n    [\"Charlie\", \"David\"]\r\n];\r\n\r\n // false\r\nconsole.log(isValidOrganization(relationships3));\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Explanation**: Both Alice and Charlie are leaders (no one manages them), violating the \"single ultimate leader\" rule.\r\n\r\n### Example 4: Invalid Organization (Disconnected)\r\n```javascript\r\nconst relationships4 = [\r\n    [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"],\r\n    [\"Alice\", \"Charlie\"],\r\n    [\"David\", \"Eve\"]\r\n];\r\n\r\n // false\r\nconsole.log(isValidOrganization(relationships4));\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Explanation**: The organization is split into two separate hierarchies (Alice's group and David's group).\r\n\r\n## Edge Cases to Consider\r\n\r\n- Empty relationships array\r\n- Single person organization\r\n- Duplicate relationships\r\n- Self-reporting (person managing themselves)\r\n\r\n## Constraints\r\n\r\n- 1 ≤ relationships.length ≤ 1000\r\n- All names are non-empty strings\r\n- Names are case-sensitive. Same names with different casing should be considered separate employees.\r\n\r\n## Hints\r\n\r\nThink about this problem in terms of graph theory:\r\n- Each person is a node\r\n- Each reporting relationship is a directed edge\r\n- A valid organization forms a tree structure\r\n- Consider using DFS/BFS for cycle detection and connectivity checking\r\n\r\n## Submission\r\n\r\nStart the timer, complete your solution, test your solution against the test cases provided by the platform, and submit it.
