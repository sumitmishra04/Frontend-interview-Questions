2 Pointers
Valid Pallindrome(use isAlphanumeric function and charCodeAt(0) to get ascii value)
twoSum (poiners from 2 ends and they will move left or right based on current sum if greater than target or lesser than)
3sum (sort numbers, loop on it, create left and right by skippin duplicate i. then check for sum ===0 and move left and right to aoid duplicate)
maxArea (while i<j and calculate area and maxarea and moveon with i++ or j-- based on at which point height is lower)
trappingRainWater (calculate leftMaxArray and rightMaxArray, then calculate totalWater sum by min of left and max at each index - current height)

Sliding window
maxProfit (track minPrice and maxProfit, minPrice will be updated anytime currentprice < minPrice else we will update profit by checking if the curent profit is higher than existing one)
lengthOfLongestSubstring (use set to store substring which will be used for maxlen. use left and right. right will move and add to set. while we also ensure that if a matching right is found in set, we delete from set until the characters until matched item is removed and move left)
Longest Repeating Character Replacement (Expand a sliding window while the number of characters to replace (window length - max frequency in window) ≤ k; if it exceeds k, shrink from the left. Keep updating the maximum window length seen)
permutaionInString (isanagram with sliding window.)

Stack
Valid parenthesis (create a map of closing:opening bracket and then push all open ones and if close ones are found pop and compare with the map. at last return stack.length === 0)

Binary Search
Find lowest in rotated sorted array (if num[mid] > right lowest on the left side else on the right side. return nums[left])
Find elememt in rotated sorted array (2 layer check. while(left<=right), check at mid, then check if left part sorted or not, in left check if target lies in the left to mid range or not)
