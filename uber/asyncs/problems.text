maplimit
concurrency
Understand Promise Queues (building blocks of request pools, worker threads)
Implement a Full concurrency Polyfill (limit max concurrent async tasks dynamically)
Build a Rate-Limited Request Handler (great for APIs like GitHub, Stripe)
Once you're comfortable with these, you'll be able to:

Handle large-scale API requests efficiently
Optimize async operations in Node.js / Browsers
Control concurrency based on available system resources
